# Complex Objects Conclusion

In this section, we have learned that classes act as blueprints for objects.
When we define a class, we decide what attributes and behaviors (methods) should
be associated with the objects. Then when instances of the class &mdash; the
objects &mdash; are created, they have those state and behavioral properties.

We worked through a few tasks such as:

* Creating a domain model with different types of object associations

* Writing instance methods that manipulate nested data structures

* Building a fully functional object-oriented program

We also introduced code design principles that object-oriented programmers
commonly use. With this knowledge, we are able to use the domain model to write
maintainable code in larger scale applications.
