# Building Complex Class Objects in Ruby Conclusion

We should now understand that classes act as blueprints for objects. These
objects have state and behavioral properties. We can then establish what
attributes and behaviors that each object should have. In addition to this
previously discussed concept, we introduced code design principles that
object-oriented programmers commonly use. Using the domain model can empower you
to write maintainable code in larger scale applications.

We worked through a few tasks such as creating a database model for a domain
model with different types of object associations, writing instance methods that
manipulate nested data structures, and building an object oriented program.
