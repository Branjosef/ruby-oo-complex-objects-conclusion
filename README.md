# Building Complex Class Objects in Ruby Conclusion

Now, we should understand that classes act as blueprints for objects. These
objects have state and behavioral properties, and we can then establish what
attributes and behaviors that each object should have.

We worked through a few tasks such as: 
* Creating a database model for a domain model with different types of object associations
* Writing instance methods that manipulate nested data structures
* Building a fully functional object oriented program

In addition to this previously discussed concept, we introduced code design
principles that object-oriented programmers commonly use. With this knowledge,
we are able to use the domain model can empower you to write maintainable code
in larger scale applications.
